My name is Clyde Schwab, and I'm a graduating fourth year studying geography at the University of Chicago. I'm interested broadly in applying spatial analysis to policy issues including housing, criminal justice, health, and education. 

Here on my github page you'll find project files for a number of projects and classes I've worked on. 

I'm developing a portfolio website that will be up soon, as well as a project page for my BA thesis on gentrification in Berlin. 

Shoot me an email at clydeschwab@gmail.com or cschwab1@uchicago.edu if you have any questions!
